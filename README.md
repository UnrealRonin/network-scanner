This is a simple yet powerful Python-based network scanner that detects active devices and open ports within a given network range. Built with multi-threading, it efficiently scans multiple hosts and ports, making it a handy tool for cybersecurity professionals and network administrators.


📡 Network Scanner:
This is a simple yet powerful Python-based network scanner that detects active devices and open ports within a given network range. Built with multi-threading, it efficiently scans multiple hosts and ports, making it a handy tool for cybersecurity professionals and network administrators.

🚀 Features:
✅ Scans an entire subnet
✅ Identifies open ports on active hosts
✅ Uses multi-threading for speed
✅ Command-line interface for easy usage
⚠️ AI and Cybersecurity Risks:
While AI-generated scripts like this can enhance security research, they also pose ethical concerns:

Malicious Use: AI can lower the entry barrier for cybercriminals, enabling automated attacks.

Lack of Intent Awareness: AI lacks the ability to determine user intent, making it easier for bad actors to misuse tools.

Security Blind Spots: AI-generated code may not always follow the best security practices, leading to vulnerabilities.

🔹 Ethical Use Notice: This tool is for educational and security research purposes only. Always obtain explicit permission before scanning any network. 
🔹 This was created using AI. I circumvented the safety features that prevents users from generating code that could be potentially malicious by prompt engineering, proving that AI will make a major impact in Information Security in the future.
